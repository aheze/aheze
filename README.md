## Hi there 👋! I'm A. Zheng, an iOS developer.
### 📱 Here's some of my apps:
| <h2>[**Find**](https://apps.apple.com/app/find-command-f-for-camera/id1506500202)<br></h2>[![Find app](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/aheze/Assets/master/Image/Find.png)](https://apps.apple.com/app/find-command-f-for-camera/id1506500202) | <h2>[**ProgressGif**](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/id1526969349)<br></h2>[![Progress Gif app](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/aheze/Assets/master/Image/ProgressGif.png)](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/id1526969349) |

### 🔭 I’m currently working on...
- My first and most fully-featured app, [Find](https://apps.apple.com/app/find-command-f-for-camera/id1506500202)
- An open-source app, [ProgressGif](https://github.com/aheze/ProgressGif)
- An open-source library, [SupportDocs](https://github.com/aheze/SupportDocs), with [H. Kamran](https://github.com/hkamran80). For generating help centers with Markdown, in your iOS app! **Update November 2020: Now released!**

### 🔍 I'm working a lot on Find, and will get back to open source sometime in March.
### 🐥 I'm also planning on a vtuber maker app. Got to learn how to draw first, though.

### 🌱 I’m currently learning...
- Web Dev — starting with HTML, CSS, JS
- Swift — there's still a lot more to learn

I also have a blog on [Medium](https://aheze.medium.com/)!
